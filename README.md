		TENDENTIOUS STRIFE
Instructions:
At the main menu, you will be required to either:
	a) Start a game
	b) Look at the leaderboard (originally empty; populates after one game is concluded)
	c) Quit the game

When you start a game, you will be prompted to select how many players are in the game from 3-6. After selecting how many players you would like,
enter names for each player. Names cannot be duplicates of each other.

After pressing start, the game will begin immediately. You will see an interface showing whose turn it is (highlighted in red). There are two buttons
on the left side of the screen: Roll Score Die and Roll Condition Die. In the first part of a player's turn, they must roll the score die (they are not
allowed to roll the condition die yet). Then, a message will appear and tell them to roll the condition die. This can result in one of many results.

The game progresses in a series of rounds. Each player takes their turn, and at the end of each round, the scoreboard will check for a winner. If there is a winner
(player has earned 100 points or more), then a message will appear, notifying them of their victory. The game will return to the main menu from here, where you
can start another game!
