To Run the Game download the source files under T_Strife and run the Main_Menu.java file to begin the GUI!

As it stands, The Main Menu, and game setup(choose how many players and their names) works in a fully implemented GUI. However the functions for the game, rolling the dice and taking actions in the game, are implemented in the console. Popups will make it evident whose turn it is, and for what die they're rolling. Simply press okay after reading them to continue the game.
